This is an Implementation for [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
### What is this repository for? ###


* Quick summary
    In this project, I have implemented the famous Conway's Game of Life  with the help of Java and React hooks.
    The rules of the games are as follows: 
    1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
    2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
